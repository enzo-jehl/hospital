Indexing:

Indexes are used to improve the performance of database queries by allowing for faster data retrieval.
Analyze your project's queries and identify columns or combinations of columns that are frequently used in search conditions.
Each group member should propose and implement appropriate indexes to optimize query performance.

Functions & Procedures:

Functions and procedures provide reusable blocks of code that can be executed within the database.
Each group member should propose and implement at least three functions and procedures that support the functionality of your project.
Functions can be used to perform calculations or return specific values, while procedures can be used to perform a series of database operations.

Triggers:

Triggers are database objects that automatically execute in response to specific events.
Each group member should propose and implement at least three triggers that capture important business rules or data integrity constraints in your project.
Triggers can be used to enforce referential integrity, validate data, or perform additional actions when certain conditions are met.

Appointment-Patient Relationship:

Type: Many-to-One (or Many appointments to One patient)
Explanation: Each appointment can be associated with only one patient, but a patient can have multiple appointments.
It is a Many-to-One relationship because multiple appointments can be linked to the same patient.
